  <h1>Magi Lore</h1>
  <p>Through time, the practice of magic has been a volatile and pivotal part of our folklore and history. Wars were waged and people were killed through the ages in the name of magic. The world around everyone in the magical world was changing and in that, the Magi were called upon to help to seal the documents of the magical world to keep them safe in the hands of the Archivists. Blow the land ran the veins that carried natural energy, flowing through the Earth. Feeding the natural and magical world that lived above it. When the ley lines began to drain and magic slipped from the world going dormant, those who practiced would attempt to find other ways of gaining the energies that they needed to do minor spells here or there. Conduits would be used when stronger and more powerful magic was needed, but even then it would be reserved for emergencies.</p>
  <p>Most of the Magi would assimilate to the non-magical world and attempt to try to live as normal a life as they could after feeling the strain of the magic slipping away from their control. In the course of time it was reduced to nothing more than what we today would call parlor tricks, sleight of hand, or smoke and mirrors. There are always remnants of magic that is seen or felt in nature and it was in that, those who would feel the pull and draw of magic in their core, would find that  the elements themselves could aid them in keeping what magic they still had alive. The descendants of the gifted  would keep their secrets hidden away.</p>
  <p>When the ley lines began to surge back to life, there was a slight awakening to those who were dormant for so long, and their magical power would be erratic and unstable. Slowly there were a few that managed to gain a grasp on their skills and in that attempted to help out the Society of the Archivists in keeping everything safe. Starving for information and guidance, those who had access to the tomes and Grimoires of the past would absorb as much as they could in an attempt to try out their newfound abilities. Teams of Archivists were sent to examine the areaâ€™s of ley line convergence and while they were there, the magi amongst them would use the draw of power to divine the location and help find those in the world who were Gifted.</p>
  <p>The magi in the world of the past are vastly different from those who are re-emerging today. Many of the gifted do not have the ability of control, are inexperienced, and lack the training to use their magical abilities in any coherent way. Their elemental alignments are dormant and are not fully recognized until the early teenage years. Unlike others who enter the school, Magi are the only students who will not have a biological natural affinity. Not like the other races.Through teaching and guidance, those who have the ability to manipulate and control the elements will find their way again. It will take great training and a reconnection with the elements to allow for the Magi to gain full control of their powers again.  </p>
