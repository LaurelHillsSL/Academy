	<h1>Society of the Archivists</h1>
	<p>The Society of the Archivists was formed as a way for those that still possessed magic, could protect the artifacts and texts of the past under lock and key. Wards were placed over the building, through and through. As the remainder of their magic spread over the windows and doors of the building, the shimmer would fade leaving inside the now guarded items representing the remaining pieces of the past. The members of the society took a vow to protect the history of the races and magic with their lives. There was always a cost to protect secrets from those who wished to destroy them, this would be the highest sacrifice that someone could make. </p>
	<p>The location of the Archivist headquarters was to be kept secret, and in that so was the information. Upon the selected archivist being indoctrinated to the folds of the society, there would be a series of magical things that would happen. Upon the selected candidate entering the society, their name would go into the manifest, the book working as a link between all of their minds. It allowed for them to communicate information magically and secretively, but this also meant that when someone was removed from the ranks, their name would be cut off from the book and sever the link. If an archivist was to be put under duress, or was to be killed, it created a magical seal that would lock away the information that the archivist knew. Protecting the information that they knew from post-mortem magic, through the use of Necromancy.</p>
	<p>Over time the archivists would continue to work at gathering different items that could possibly hold either historical or magical value. These items would be stored in various different locations around the world, loaned and rotated through museums and other locations to keep them safe. When the items would be loaned out to museums, there would be magical wards placed on the displays to prevent theft. Over time, they tried to gather all the information they could decipher from the ancient texts and relics. Trying to unlock the information that they could use that could be helpful to them in keeping everyone safe. When the ley lines started to surge the artifacts and texts of the past would leech and feed off the magic. Slowly things would begin to appear, words would start to make sense. It was in this that more reports were coming in from across the globe of things starting to happen. </p>
	<p>The council of the society contacted their most trusted associates and would be commissioned for the design and protection of a school for those with abilities. In that they decided that a school was to be created, there to educate and protect the children that would soon find their powers growing and not understand what was happening. So the first wave of Archivists were sent to Tennessee to the newly founded Laurel Hills Academy, and started to filter through the Loire collection of artifacts and texts. Setting up the Archives and vault and when the decision was made, they chose the associate that would serve as the schoolâ€™s first Archivist. Leaving them to help run and assist the school, alongside the headmaster and the overseer of the estate. </p>
