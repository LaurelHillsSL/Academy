  <p>From the shadows and in the darkness were vampires said to have originated. Whispers, Myth, Theories, and Lore were shared among vampires since the dark ages about their story and their beginning. Their existence was true, and known across the world, mentioned by many names, and spoken of in countless stories. But the question remained, where do they come from? Their father was said to be Cain while Lilith was thought to be their kind mother. A biblical tale told for generations that were circled with doubt. Down the ancient halls of forgotten knowledge the Archivist’s gossip of their alchemic creation through forbidden blood magic and curses created by a mad man's obscene experiments. Created, Summoned, Conjured, or Cursed. These beginnings meant nothing to the children of the night as the truth to their existence was one they intended to keep a secret. Stories of their kind spread for many millennia, building reputations from the mention of Dracula and Jiangshi, to Gothic Romance Films and movies with sparkling interpretations.</p>
  <p>The only truth known is that these creatures were swift, intelligent, and cunning. Hiding in plain sight and the hunters from the shadows, they built quite the reputation and mythical societies for manipulating their way into power and taking control. But all of these things faded when they faded from the world. As the flow of magic seemed to vanish, so did they, without a trace. Being gone for so long, they were thought to have actually been a myth or just the Scary Story on the night of Halloween, but this was of course far from the truth. As time moved on, so did the Lords and Ladies of the night. The curse that drove their kind began to fade as they made children and multiplied. The blood of the pure, mixed, diluted, and corrupted much too far with the blood of mortals causing a result that wasn't so soon expected, even by the oldest of their kind.</p>
  <p>In the modern-day, the vampires walk alongside mortals as beings known as "Thin Bloods". These Thin Blood are the lowest of the low and seen as abominations by their own kind. These Children of the night are the result of the cursed blood growing thin in the new members of their society. Their lack of potency relates them more closely to humans as their hearts still beat, their bodies crave food, and they often stop age somewhere in their 20s, making it mildly difficult for them to live side by side with the humans of the modern day. Though their kind comes with perks, they also have a handful of downsides. The Thin Bloods' Vampiric nature causes them to often be pale in complexion and struggle with easy sun burns as remnants of their ancestors inability to walk in the light of day. In addition, the Thin Bloods, like their ancestors also have a thirst for blood, however it’s not required for their survival and the urge to consume it is not as intense, though Thin Bloods tend to prefer their meats rare. Traits that they lack that make them freaks of their own kind is the lack of Fangs, Claws, Supernatural levels of strength, or Heightened senses, causing them to feel Alienated from their more potent brothers and sisters. A trait that managed to stay with them in this journey to weakened blood, was their predatory speed, their Affinity towards the Winds, and the ability of Suggestion.</p>
  <p>Suggestion is an extremely weakened form of the Compulsion ability that the Vampires once held. Whereas a mortal would originally have been enthralled by a simple gaze from these creatures of the night, suggestion can merely implant a thought or idea into a person's mind, however this doesn’t necessarily mean that it would cause the targeted individual to act on it.</p>
  <p>Elders of their kind envy their level of immunity to the light of day, while some fear their potential and believe them to be a risk to their very existence as they were capable of having natural-born children to a species known as Dhampirs.</p>
  <p>Undesired and unwanted by the elders of their kind, Thin Bloods and Dhampirs are often abandoned by their makers or parents, expected to fend for themselves and survive in the modern-day. This discriminated group would soon find a light at the end of the tunnel once the flow of magic once again began to course through the world, and gateways to self-growth were made clear. Where the ancients saw abominations, the archivists saw magical prowess in the demographic of what was effectively superhuman. Often discovered by these overseers of knowledge, they are guided and directed to Laurel Hills Academy where they are given mentorship by one of their own kind and given the opportunity to learn more about the magical arts, giving them the opportunity to make something of themselves in their own portion of society.</p>
