  <h1>OOC Staff Guide</h1>
  <p>Thank you for choosing to spend your valuable time with us here creating a roleplay that is fun and interactive for everyone. We appreciate the effort and time that it will take each and every one of you to produce the classes that you are planning on teaching. With this being a new roleplay experience, please have patience with the growing pains and try to communicate with us when there are issues and problems. That being said though we would like for you to read over some of the things that we are expecting of our staff here at the school.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All classes need to have a clear and concise syllabus for the students to follow, as well as the OOC staff so that they can ensure that they can administer the exams for the class at the end of each quarter.</li>
    <li>All the classes should be approximately an hour. We understand that may cause classes to go over, and perhaps overlap a little but this is what happens sometimes in a real life environment. </li>
    <li>Each instructor will be issued a mesh book to be placed either in the classroom that you choose to use each quarter on the bookshelf or deposited in the Archives so that students can access your class information. The book has a library script inside that allows for the storage of notecards. Each class you teach needs to be notecarded, logged, and saved. A copy of that notecard then needs to be placed inside the mesh book that corresponds to the class.</li>
    <li>Each instructor will be given a link to an online gradebook. At the end of each class, or if there is an assignment, the grade for class or the homework needs to be recorded in the gradebook. We understand that this seems to be a lot to keep track of, but it helps for us to be able to keep track of who is doing what on the sim and which spells they are getting credit for.</li>
    <li>We would like for the staff of the school to also be involved with the students. Host clubs, offer tutoring, make yourself approachable and available. All of this is conducive for all members of the community to have long and lasting roleplays with other members of the community. </li>
    <li>As of right now there is no available staff housing, however if you are interested in running one of the businesses here in the town please speak to a sim administrator and see what is available. </li>
    <li>
      The grading scale for the school is as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>A - (90% - 100%)</li>
        <li>B - (80% - 89%)</li>
        <li>C - (70% - 79%)</li>
        <li>D - (60% - 69%)</li>
        <li>F - (0% - 59%) </li>
      </ul>
      Please ensure that this is included in your class Syllabus.
    </li>
    <li>The class syllabus for the class that you are wanting to teach is due to the Sim Administration two weeks prior to the start of the new quarter. This will allow everyone time to prepare for the upcoming term.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the other instructors, sim adminâ€™s, and sim owners for assistance with content for the classes and or to bounce ideas off of.</p>
