  <p>Elves can live up to 500 years</p>
  <p>Affinity: Life</p>
  <p>Elves are strongly tied to the natural world, making them more at home surrounded by plants and animals. With a simple touch they can cause a flower to bloom, or reverse the effects of the withering on a rose. This affinity is both their greatest strength and weakness: Elves have always felt a mild discomfort when inside human buildings; even more so when constructed with modern materials such as steel and reinforced concrete; preferring instead to  incorporate the natural world, including living trees and branches woven together. By contrast, the elves consider human building materials to be dead, decaying, or inert, and wholly uncomfortable. This effect is lower in half and quarter elves. Elves have always held themselves somewhat distant from humans. Their capital forests are built in magically dense places, separate from the unnaturally designed and constructed human towns . Despite this, elves have always welcomed Humans into their forested sanctuaries, especially human magi. Elves have always had the highest regard for those who serve as their peopleâ€™s ambassadors since they selflessly give to better the whole of the elven nation, leaving their magically dense and nourishing environments to bring knowledge and trade to and from their forest nations.</p>
  <p>Elves were the first to note the diminishing of magic in the world as a whole. Already somewhat withdrawn they were quick to cloister themselves away. As the inquisitions geared up, the elven physical features set them obviously apart. The few ambassadors managed to get word to their Magi allies and back to their forested nations. Initial wards and barriers kept the humans out who were intent on destroying them. However the humans quickly found out if the forests around the Elfish nation capitols were destroyed it began to starve the magic out of the capitals. Then in true siege fashion the humans were able to destroy the capital forests. Luckily the dying nations managed to get word to the other capitols and a new spell was worked. Drawing all remaining Elvin forest capitals into a singular Elven land with no entry behind a great barrier viel. The Elvin people were finally able to live safely. Growing their homes within the trees and forests themselves. </p>
  <p>This however did not stop the new Grand Elvin Council, or the surviving Ambassadors. It was decided the Ambassadors would rest up from the wearies of their made flights home. Two new spells were designed over the course of 100 years. The first spell would enable 5 Ambassadors to exit through the barrier viel. The one drawback was they could never return. Which is where the second spell would come into play. Buried deep in the minds of the Ambassadors. This spell would reconnect the Elvish realm back to the forest of the world. Although it did take 3 Elves to work the spell together. Due to the potential dangers of destroying the last bastion of the Elves, The spell was designed to not work under duress of any kind. It was in fact designed to burn away all magic in an elf if extreme duress was used. </p>
  <p>Although there were several safeguards and back up plans. Any one Elf could pass the spell on to their child. The Grand Council would also ask for new volunteers every 400 years. Elves still took up the mantle of Ambassador. The names of the Elves would still be recorded in the great books of honor. As well as any children they may eventually make their way back to the forests once the spell to connect the world to the Elven nation was cast. </p>
  <p>There is an interesting quirk of Elvish biology and magic that enables the magic to be passed on. Elvish genetics are additive not multiplicative. So two half elves will make a full elf. Two quarter elves will make a half Elf. However, at an eighth of the magic the child will be fully human.</p>
