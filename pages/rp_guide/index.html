  <h1>RP Guidelines</h1>
  <p>
    It is important before you enter into any Roleplay sim or Roleplay that you understand the basics of what entails proper roleplay. If you do not understand the basics, then you might feel a bit lost at first. Below you will find some useful information regarding issues that you could come across.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "roleplay">
  <h2>What Is Roleplay?</h2>
  <p>
    Role-play (RP) is a social activity in which players assume roles of their own fictional characters and interact with one another. There are specific community rules, player guidelines, and the city background to consider while participating.
  </p>

 <section id="ic_vs_ooc">
  <h2>In-character (IC) vs Out-Of-Character (OOC)</h2>
  <p>This is the most important concept to understand for role-play:<br/>
    In-character (IC) describes the state of acting through the eyes, ears, and body of your fictional character. Basically, all physical actions and conversations would be based as if you are really the character, through the emoting and writing guidelines detailed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out-of-character (OOC) describes responses and interactions with others as your real-self, in out-of-story context. Basically, being OOC means you are not role-playing and are restricted to communicating in IMs and group chats. If you need to break character temporarily, you may do so by surrounding your text in brackets, for example: (( I need to use the restroom, I’ll brb. )) Please do not copy and paste large chunks of information into local chat either.  If you need to do this please do it in IM.
  </p>
  <p>
    IC versus OOC also reflects the nature of your relationship with another player and understanding the difference between what characters say or do In-Character and what goes on Out-Of-Character is paramount to a healthy storyline and preventing metagaming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try to avoid talking excessively in local using brackets, as it is distracting from the Roleplay, please keep the messages as much to IM's as you can during active scenes to avoid derailing the continuation of the scene in your absence.
  </p>  
 </section>
 <section id = "consent">
  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>
    As spontaneous and unpredictable role-play situations can be, all players are entitled to personal limits. Since forced fantasy is a prevalent theme, consent may already be established. If you are uncomfortable with certain actions being imposed on your character, IM the other player and inform them immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are in the middle of a scene and find yourself unable to continue playing, you should IM the other player and indicate you want to “void” (never happened) the scene or “fade to black” (agree to skip details and jump to conclusion). Voiding a scene is generally bad practice, especially if there are multiple players involved and time spent is wasted.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "emote">
  <h2>Emote (/me)</h2>
  <p>
    To communicate and interact with other players in role-play, you should emote. In Second Life, this means to use the /me command as you portray yourself in the third person, followed by the physical actions, thoughts, feelings, and/or speech (in quotations) of your character. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The following examples are responses you could type if you were playing this female character:
  </p>
  <p>
    /me sits upright as she notices the cop entering the lobby. “Oh hey, Officer. Is there anything I can help you with?”
  </p>
  <p>
    /me feels the cold damp bricks on her back as she remains trapped against the wall; she feels a trickle of moisture seeping through her clothes. “Please,” she whimpers, “please, it's very cold…”
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, gestures and chat abbreviations (ie. lol, omg, etc.) are not allowed in role-play. Always emote and be descriptive in your posts.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "take_turns">
  <h2>Take Turns</h2>
  <p>
    Role-play is a turn-based activity. When someone posts, you should respond with a single post, then wait for your turn to respond again. If there are multiple players involved, take your turn in order. This allows everyone a fair chance to respond to a situation before it is your turn to post again.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "shotgun_post">
  <h2>Don't Post Multiple Times in a Row</h2>
  <p>
    Double or multiple-posting means to break your actions and responses into multiple posts. It creates confusion with multiple dialogs between players, doesn’t indicate when you’re done responding, and does not allow other players to keep track of order in a scene. Always put your action and response together in a SINGLE post. 
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "play_fair">
  <h2>Play Fair</h2>
  <p>
    As emphasized above, role-play is consensual. If your character is interacting physically with another player, every action you post must always be an attempt, or what you are trying to do to the other player. This gives the other player flexibility and chances to either accept or deflect what you are trying to do to them. Combat and forced fantasy scenes are especially handled this way.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "powergaming">
  <h2>Powergaming</h2>
  <p>
    If one attacks without any social interaction, uses excessive force, or post the result of an attack on another character, then they are powergaming. Besides losing respect from other players, if reported, the offenders may find themselves ejected from groups and banned.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good example of Roleplay:<br /> /me snarls angrily, draws his pipe back and the charges towards the Hobo in hopes to strike him. “I'll show you!” he screams.<br />
    ((one action and one move))
  </p>
  <p>
    A bad example of Roleplay using Powergaming:<br />/me snarls angrily, draws his pipe back and jumps on the hobo. He then swings his pipe at his head and knocks him out cold.<br />
    ((you can not determine another characters reaction to what you are doing and you must give them the opportunity to dodge, react and or escape.))
    </p>
</section>
<section id = "metagaming">
  <h2>Metagaming</h2>
  <p>
    Metagaming occurs when a player uses knowledge their character would not be privy to (obtained through OOC means) and uses it during in-character role-play to alter outcomes in a scene or storyline in their favor. A common example of this violation is to read an avatar name and use that name in-character to address someone. Unless your character actually met this other character or had knowledge of them through role-play, there is no possible way your character would have known their name (the same goes for character background, history, and any other life detail that has not been role-played out).
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "godmoding">
  <h2>Godmoding</h2>
  <p>
    Godmodding is either trying to control another person's character or making a character who is too perfect or too powerful. Make sure when you role-play that you describe only your character's actions and responses to other character's actions.  You should NEVER include another character's response to your action in your own action. Don't make a character who knows everything, can do anything, and be careful when creating their skills and abilities; everyone has limits and they should be reasonable.
  <p>
    Never role-play permanently disfiguring someone's character; ripping out an eye, cutting off an ear without OOC consent. In your mind they may grow back, but that may not be the beliefs of someone else. Always, always get permission.
