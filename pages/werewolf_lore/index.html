  <h1>Werewolf Lore</h1>

  <p>Affinity: Earth</p>
  <p>It is hard to say for certain where the first werewolves came from: As long as there has been man and magic, there have been those able to assume aspects of the natural world. It is entirely possible that there are multiple origins and this is merely a case of convergent research. For this reason, we cannot rule out the possibility that there are yet unknown variations. However, at the time of writing, there has only been one genus discovered. The rituals to create these beings from mundane man may be some of the oldest magicks heard of, but the specifics have long since been lost to antiquity.<p>
  <p>In less technologically advanced times, there were numerous advantages to this metaphysical union of human being and animal: ranging from greater speed and improved strength, to infiltration and superior senses. In some communities these rituals were performed so often that they did not need to be performed any longer, each generation inherited these magical attributes from one to the next.</p>
  <p>The spread of organized religion and empires during the more ‘civilized’ eras forced these communities of werewolves and their secrets into hiding. It is hypothesized that there are other groups of 'weres’ lurking on the periphery of the modern civilized world, but their secretive nature and distrust of outsiders has kept all but one group concealed from the archivists.</p>
  <p>The werewolves, or 'man-wolves' have elected to make themselves known to the magical community, bringing with them their knowledge, history and rich uniqueness. This decision was not an easy one, and many groups remain hidden. Choosing to reveal themselves was  largely based on practicality: Ever increasing cultivation of land caused more and more sightings of hominid beings turning into wolves on the full moon.</p>
  <p>Yes, some of the fantastical lore depicted in Hollywood movies has some truth to it. The werewolf, if not having recently released their pent up instincts by transforming into a wolf, may be compelled to do so on a full moon. The exact reason for this is currently unknown, but it seems to happen regardless of the individual's view of the lunar event, whether obstructed or otherwise.</p>
  <p>The transformation, whether compelled or voluntary, is a painful one. Bones, muscle, and organs shift, stretch, and twist their way between forms. Stopping a shift or preventing one is possible through the application of monkshood, also known as 'wolfsbane'. As this herb is also highly toxic to humans, one cannot use this plant to determine if an individual is a were, as both will become quite sick.</p>
  <p>Limited healing occurs between forms. Wounds and bones may close and knit, acting like a ‘reset’ of their physical form. The werewolf’s skin warps and stretches but remains fundamentally the same between forms, carrying with it cosmetic changes such as tattoos, scars, birthmarks, freckles, and stretch marks. Look beneath the fur and you may see each of these distinguishing features buried below. Transformation does not purge illness or poison from the werewolf's blood.</p>
  <p>The application of silver does not seem to cause additional harm to the werewolf, in fact the antimicrobial aspects of silver may allow them to heal from an inflicted wound faster than a wound made with steel. We cannot rule out that there was once, or perhaps still is but unproven, a genus of Lycanthrope similar but different to the werewolves which does spread through the application of a curse which may be susceptible to silver, like the famed ‘Loup Garou’ of fictional works; however, there have been no documented cases of these creatures.</p>
  <p>While at one time, back in antiquity, each werewolf was created through a ritual often considered ‘sacred’, certain communities relied on this magic to the point that their bloodlines began carrying the magic between generations. As these spells pre-date the written word, there is scarce information available on the specifics and may even have required druidic rituals involving the invoking of ‘spirits of the forest’, according to handed down legends anyway. As such, their enchantment does not spread to others.</p>
  <p>As they are essentially enchanted humans, a werewolf is capable of pairing with a human and bringing forth viable offspring. The effects of this result in either a conventional human, or a werewolf. The magic does not ‘water down’, nor does it ‘skip’ generations. However, this does result in a 50/50 chance of producing non-were offspring.</p>
  <p>Werewolf communities typically practiced little of the arcane, this is not to say they could not utilize or learn magicks, but as they are unable to practice these arts in their wolf-form, and their communities tend towards the more primal aspects of life, there was little need for it. The inclusion of the werewolves into the magical community has created an upsurge among the youth of ‘pups’ leaving their families to learn magic. Due to the movement of young wolves away from their heritage and the chance for mixed couplings to result in conventional humans, there is a stigma around magic and the Archivists in older populations, leading them to remain somewhat isolationist.</p>
