  <h2>OOC Rules Regarding Child Avatars</h2>
 <p>
  Laurel Hills Academy is a sim for Child RP. The ages of the children that will be portrayed will be between the ages of 10-18. Due to the characters being portrayed on the sim being minors, we will be strictly enforcing the rules regarding child avatars as stated in the ‘Linden Labs TOS on Child Avatars.’ They can be found here, read them:

  <h2>Character Creation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All played characters <strong>MUST</strong> have an application submitted and approved prior to being  involved in active role-play on the sim.</li>
    <li>All characters created for the sim need to have natural skin tones. The overall every day appearance of your character needs to be humanoid. No anime body shapes, heads, eyes. No furry avatars. etc. </li>
    <li>Overall appearance of the characters created must be realistic looking in height. If you have any questions on what might be an age appropriate height for the character you are creating, please ask for assistance.</li>
    <li>We do ask that you keep your clothing leaning more to the modest side. Please see the clothing reference photos if you need further help with length and other information.</li>
    <li>We welcome the use of players incorporating other languages into their role-play. We allow a player's character to speak 3 languages. However, everyone <strong>MUST</strong> have English as one of the languages that they speak. If your character uses a foregin language in their role-play, you need to use brackets and place the translation of what you are saying in the brackets.</li>
    <li>Come from somewhere where people speak with an accent? Awesome! Keep in mind though that for some players, their first language in real life might not be English. Using an accent while typing could get a little confusing. Just be open to IM’s if people need clarification.</li>
    <li>We welcome players to flush out their backstories and write in detail. Do keep in mind though, the more detailed you get, you might prevent character growth in the future.</li>
    <li>We welcome the creativity of role-players in their character creation on the sim. We want for your characters to be individuals, to embrace cultures and different ways of playing your character. In this, those of you using spells on the sim, embrace your creativity in casting. However, the hud is set up to recognize the spells that are in the system we have created. When you are using a spell, make sure you use the corresponding spell to which your character is attempting to do. Below is an example:
      <br/>
      <br/>Float / Lift / Push / Pull (Would be the roll on the hud)
      <br />
      <br />/me quietly sat at the table, crossing her arms over her chest as her gaze locked upon the glass that sat before her. “komtilr mik” (Come here) as the tea cup slid over the surface of the table and her hand lowered to grasp it gently. (Post)
</li>
</ul>

  <h2>OOC Sim Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The sim owners and administration work hard to maintain and operate the sim behind the scenes and deserve their own time to get to take breaks and role-play. There are designated accounts for handling and processing sim administration duties. There are channels provided and many other avenues for you to ask for assistance. Please do not contact the sim personnel on their player accounts. If people message the player accounts of owners or admins there will be consequences.</li>
    <li>We understand that dating and having relationships is part of growing up. However, under no circumstances will sexual relationships, and/or teen pregnacy of any kind be permitted. Be it in Local or IM’s, this is a direct violation of Linden Lab’s TOS on child avatars and will be reported to Linden Lab’s and the player will be banned from the sim.</li>
    <li>We understand that teenagers are known to be rebellious from time to time.That being said, the use of tobacco, alcohol, and or drugs is not permissible on the sim. At no time should any minor avatar be roleplaying out an addiction to any substance.</li>
    <li>There is to be no pornography of any kind. If you are posting photos of the sim, please keep them modest and understand this is the environment that we are creating for players to feel safe.</li>
    <li>The life of a pirate seems amazing, however their vocabulary is not. Please understand that swearing on the sim, and other forms of the sim’s communication, needs to be kept to a minimum and respect that other players that play minor avatars might not like to be around the kind of talk that your mamma would rinse your mouth out with soap over!</li>
    <li>SL has been about us embracing our creativity and also being ourselves. However, please do remember that this is a school for minor aged avatars. Remember to remove any and all dangly bits or bobs, slappers, spankers, etc. Remember, cover up and play your age.</li>
    <li>Under no circumstances shall there be even suggestion or insinuation of any type of sexual assult or misconduct to your minor avatar. This type of situation is already quite touchy for some and even more so inappropriate for minor avatars. </li>
    <li>Check your adult fantasies and fetishes off sim and remember, you are playing a minor. We don’t want to see it, hear about it, or even know it's on your radar.</li>
    <li>Although we have different avenues of communication such as OOC Chat, Discord, etc. We need to emphasize that these public chats need to remain PG. If members can not comply,there will be consequences. </li>
    <li>We here at Laurel Hills Academy, strive to be inclusive. All forms of bullying, fighting, slander, racism, etc. will be met with the harshest of punishments. It is our goal to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for all the players on the sim, if you are found to be harassing other players OOC, this will be addressed immediately and could result in a sim ban.</li>
    <li>However, this is not strictly a child avatar only sim. Meaning, that there will be adult avatars on sim that will follow the same rules as stated by Linden Labs regarding child avatars. If anyone, regardless of an adult portrayed avatar or child, is found breaking or insinuating that there are any violations, we will not hesitate to ban players from the sim. We can not stress the importance of this to you enough.</li>
    <li>Although this does not and can not possibly cover everything that would/could possibly fall under this category for ‘just no!’ We do retain the right to review any and/or all suggestive topics that are deemed inappropriate for children to be participating in.</li>
    <li>Alts on the sim need to be declared at the time of your application to the sim admins. There is a limit of 3 different characters/alts on the sim for any player. We wish to assure you that your privacy is important to us, and only the sim administrators will have access to the application files.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The sim owners and admin’s reserve the right to revise and or change the rules when there is something that needs to be addressed. However, notice will be served if there are changes to the rules.

  <h2>OOC Rules Regarding Punishments</h2>
  <p>
    We understand that sometimes people just have an off day, or things happen. However, there are some cases when steps need to be taken by the sim administration to keep the roleplay environment flowing and safe for all players on the sim. If situations are deemed inappropriate by the Administration of the sim, there will be steps taken.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Warning by the Sim Administration.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Final warning by the Sim Administration.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> A sim ban, length to be determined by Sim Administration on a case by case basis.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> A player based ban from the sim. (Does not matter the characters, all accounts will be banned from the sim.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you feel that you have been unjustly punished for an infraction, please feel free to contact the Sim Administrators to file an appeal to the decisions. Understand that they do not act without cause and proof. If you plan on appealing the decision of the Administration team, please have evidence/proof ready to submit.
