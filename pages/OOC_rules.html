  <h2>OOC Rules Regarding Child Avatars</h2>
 <p>
  Laurel Hills Academy is a sim for Child RP. The ages of the children that will be portrayed will be between the ages of 10-18. Due to the characters being portrayed on the sim being minors, we will be strictly enforcing the rules regarding child avatars as stated in the ‘Linden Labs TOS on Child Avatars.’ They can be found here, read them:

  <h2>Character Creation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All played characters <strong>MUST</strong> have an application submitted and approved prior to being  involved in active role-play on the sim.</li>
    <li>All characters created for the sim need to have natural skin tones. The overall every day appearance of your character needs to be humanoid. No anime body shapes, heads, eyes. No furry avatars. etc. </li>
    <li>Overall appearance of the characters created must be realistic looking in height. If you have any questions on what might be an age appropriate height for the character you are creating, please ask for assistance.</li>
    <li>We do ask that you keep your clothing leaning more to the modest side. Please see the clothing reference photos if you need further help with length and other information.</li>
    <li>We welcome the use of players incorporating other languages into their role-play. We allow a player's character to speak 3 languages. However, everyone <strong>MUST</strong> have English as one of the languages that they speak. If your character uses a foregin language in their role-play, you need to use brackets and place the translation of what you are saying in the brackets.</li>
    <li>Come from somewhere where people speak with an accent? Awesome! Keep in mind though that for some players, their first language in real life might not be English. Using an accent while typing could get a little confusing. Just be open to IM’s if people need clarification.</li>
    <li>We welcome players to flush out their backstories and write in detail. Do keep in mind though, the more detailed you get, you might prevent character growth in the future.</li>
    <li>We welcome the creativity of role-players in their character creation on the sim. We want for your characters to be individuals, to embrace cultures and different ways of playing your character. In this, those of you using spells on the sim, embrace your creativity in casting. However, the hud is set up to recognize the spells that are in the system we have created. When you are using a spell, make sure you use the corresponding spell to which your character is attempting to do. Below is an example:
      <br/>
      <br/>Float / Lift / Push / Pull (Would be the roll on the hud)
      <br />
      <br />/me quietly sat at the table, crossing her arms over her chest as her gaze locked upon the glass that sat before her. “komtilr mik” (Come here) as the tea cup slid over the surface of the table and her hand lowered to grasp it gently. (Post)
</li>
</ul>

<section id = "ooc_rules">
  <h2>OOC Sim Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The sim owners and administration work hard to maintain and operate the sim behind the scenes and deserve their own time to get to take breaks and role-play. There are designated accounts for handling and processing sim administration duties. There are channels provided and many other avenues for you to ask for assistance. Please do not contact the sim personnel on their player accounts. If people message the player accounts of owners or admins there will be consequences.</li>
    <li>We understand that dating and having relationships is part of growing up. However, under no circumstances will sexual relationships, and/or teen pregnacy of any kind be permitted. Be it in Local or IM’s, this is a direct violation of Linden Lab’s TOS on child avatars and will be reported to Linden Lab’s and the player will be banned from the sim.</li>
    <li>We understand that teenagers are known to be rebellious from time to time.That being said, the use of tobacco, alcohol, and or drugs is not permissible on the sim. At no time should any minor avatar be roleplaying out an addiction to any substance.</li>
    <li>There is to be no pornography of any kind. If you are posting photos of the sim, please keep them modest and understand this is the environment that we are creating for players to feel safe.</li>
    <li>The life of a pirate seems amazing, however their vocabulary is not. Please understand that swearing on the sim, and other forms of the sim’s communication, needs to be kept to a minimum and respect that other players that play minor avatars might not like to be around the kind of talk that your mamma would rinse your mouth out with soap over!</li>
    <li>SL has been about us embracing our creativity and also being ourselves. However, please do remember that this is a school for minor aged avatars. Remember to remove any and all dangly bits or bobs, slappers, spankers, etc. Remember, cover up and play your age.</li>
    <li>Under no circumstances shall there be even suggestion or insinuation of any type of sexual assult or misconduct to your minor avatar. This type of situation is already quite touchy for some and even more so inappropriate for minor avatars. </li>
    <li>Check your adult fantasies and fetishes off sim and remember, you are playing a minor. We don’t want to see it, hear about it, or even know it's on your radar.</li>
    <li>Although we have different avenues of communication such as OOC Chat, Discord, etc. We need to emphasize that these public chats need to remain PG. If members can not comply,there will be consequences. </li>
    <li>We here at Laurel Hills Academy, strive to be inclusive. All forms of bullying, fighting, slander, racism, etc. will be met with the harshest of punishments. It is our goal to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for all the players on the sim, if you are found to be harassing other players OOC, this will be addressed immediately and could result in a sim ban.</li>
    <li>However, this is not strictly a child avatar only sim. Meaning, that there will be adult avatars on sim that will follow the same rules as stated by Linden Labs regarding child avatars. If anyone, regardless of an adult portrayed avatar or child, is found breaking or insinuating that there are any violations, we will not hesitate to ban players from the sim. We can not stress the importance of this to you enough.</li>
    <li>Although this does not and can not possibly cover everything that would/could possibly fall under this category for ‘just no!’ We do retain the right to review any and/or all suggestive topics that are deemed inappropriate for children to be participating in.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The sim owners and admin’s reserve the right to revise and or change the rules when there is something that needs to be addressed. However, notice will be served if there are changes to the rules.
  </p>

<section id = "ooc_punishments">
  <h2>OOC Rules Regarding Punishments</h2>
  <p>
    We understand that sometimes people just have an off day, or things happen. However, there are some cases when steps need to be taken by the sim administration to keep the roleplay environment flowing and safe for all players on the sim. If situations are deemed inappropriate by the Administration of the sim, there will be steps taken.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Warning by the Sim Administration.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Final warning by the Sim Administration.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> A sim ban, length to be determined by Sim Administration on a case by case basis.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> A player based ban from the sim. (Does not matter the characters, all accounts will be banned from the sim.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you feel that you have been unjustly punished for an infraction, please feel free to contact the Sim Administrators to file an appeal to the decisions. Understand that they do not act without cause and proof. If you plan on appealing the decision of the Administration team, please have evidence/proof ready to submit.

  <h2>Basic RP Skills</h2>
  <p>
    It is important before you enter into any Roleplay sim or Roleplay that you understand the basics of what entails proper roleplay. If you do not understand the basics, then you might feel a bit lost at first. Below you will find some useful information regarding issues that you could come across.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "roleplay">
  <h2>What Is Roleplay?</h2>
  <p>
    Role-play (RP) is a social activity in which players assume roles of their own fictional characters and interact with one another. There are specific community rules, player guidelines, and the city background to consider while participating.
  </p>
 </section>
 <section id="ic_vs_ooc">
  <h2>In-character (IC) vs Out-Of-Character (OOC)</h2>
  <p>This is the most important concept to understand for role-play:<br/>
    In-character (IC) describes the state of acting through the eyes, ears, and body of your fictional character. Basically, all physical actions and conversations would be based as if you are really the character, through the emoting and writing guidelines detailed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out-of-character (OOC) describes responses and interactions with others as your real-self, in out-of-story context. Basically, being OOC means you are not role-playing and are restricted to communicating in IMs and group chats. If you need to break character temporarily, you may do so by surrounding your text in brackets, for example: (( I need to use the restroom, I’ll brb. )) Please do not copy and paste large chunks of information into local chat either.  If you need to do this please do it in IM.
  </p>
  <p>
    IC versus OOC also reflects the nature of your relationship with another player and understanding the difference between what characters say or do In-Character and what goes on Out-Of-Character is paramount to a healthy storyline and preventing metagaming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try to avoid talking excessively in local using brackets, as it is distracting from the Roleplay, please keep the messages as much to IM's as you can during active scenes to avoid derailing the continuation of the scene in your absence.
  </p>  
 </section>
 <section id = "consent">
  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>
    As spontaneous and unpredictable role-play situations can be, all players are entitled to personal limits. Since forced fantasy is a prevalent theme, consent may already be established. If you are uncomfortable with certain actions being imposed on your character, IM the other player and inform them immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are in the middle of a scene and find yourself unable to continue playing, you should IM the other player and indicate you want to “void” (never happened) the scene or “fade to black” (agree to skip details and jump to conclusion). Voiding a scene is generally bad practice, especially if there are multiple players involved and time spent is wasted.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "emote">
  <h2>Emote (/me)</h2>
  <p>
    To communicate and interact with other players in role-play, you should emote. In Second Life, this means to use the /me command as you portray yourself in the third person, followed by the physical actions, thoughts, feelings, and/or speech (in quotations) of your character. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The following examples are responses you could type if you were playing this female character:
  </p>
  <p>
    /me sits upright as she notices the cop entering the lobby. “Oh hey, Officer. Is there anything I can help you with?”
  </p>
  <p>
    /me feels the cold damp bricks on her back as she remains trapped against the wall; she feels his hand slide under her skirt. “Please,” she whimpers, “please don’t do this…”
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, gestures and chat abbreviations (ie. lol, omg, etc.) are not allowed in role-play. Always emote and be descriptive in your posts.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "take_turns">
  <h2>Take Turns</h2>
  <p>
    Role-play is a turn-based activity. When someone posts, you should respond with a single post, then wait for your turn to respond again. If there are multiple players involved, take your turn in order. This allows everyone a fair chance to respond to a situation before it is your turn to post again.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "shotgun_post">
  <h2>Don't Post Multiple Times in a Row</h2>
  <p>
    Double or multiple-posting means to break your actions and responses into multiple posts. It creates confusion with multiple dialogs between players, doesn’t indicate when you’re done responding, and does not allow other players to keep track of order in a scene. Always put your action and response together in a SINGLE post. 
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "play_fair">
  <h2>Play Fair</h2>
  <p>
    As emphasized above, role-play is consensual. If your character is interacting physically with another player, every action you post must always be an attempt, or what you are trying to do to the other player. This gives the other player flexibility and chances to either accept or deflect what you are trying to do to them. Combat and forced fantasy scenes are especially handled this way.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "powergaming">
  <h2>powergaming</h2>
  <p>
    If one attacks without any social interaction, uses excessive force, or post the result of an attack on another character, then they are powergaming. Besides losing respect from other players, if reported, the offenders may find themselves ejected from groups and banned.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good example of Roleplay:<br /> /me snarls angrily, draws his pipe back and the charges towards the Hobo in hopes to strike him. “I'll show you!” he screams.<br />
    ((one action and one move))
  </p>
  <p>
    A bad example of Roleplay using Powergaming:<br />/me snarls angrily, draws his pipe back and jumps on the hobo. He then swings his pipe at his head and knocks him out cold.<br />
    ((you can not determine another characters reaction to what you are doing and you must give them the opportunity to dodge, react and or escape.))
    </p>
</section>
<section id = "metagaming">
  <h2>Metagaming</h2>
  <p>
    Metagaming occurs when a player uses knowledge their character would not be privy to (obtained through OOC means) and uses it during in-character role-play to alter outcomes in a scene or storyline in their favor. A common example of this violation is to read an avatar name and use that name in-character to address someone. Unless your character actually met this other character or had knowledge of them through role-play, there is no possible way your character would have known their name (the same goes for character background, history, and any other life detail that has not been role-played out).
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "godmoding">
  <h2>Godmoding</h2>
  <p>
    Godmodding is either trying to control another person's character or making a character who is too perfect or too powerful. Make sure when you role-play that you describe only your character's actions and responses to other character's actions.  You should NEVER include another character's response to your action in your own action. Don't make a character who knows everything, can do anything, and be careful when creating their skills and abilities; everyone has limits and they should be reasonable.
  <p>
    Never role-play permanently disfiguring someone's character; ripping out an eye, cutting off an ear without OOC consent. In your mind they may grow back, but that may not be the beliefs of someone else. Always, always get permission.
  </p>
</section>
<section id = "alt_policy">
  <h2>Alt Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Alts on the sim need to be declared at the time of your application to the sim admins. There is a limit of 3 different characters/alts on the sim for any player. We wish to assure you that your privacy is important to us, and only the sim administrators will have access to the application files.
