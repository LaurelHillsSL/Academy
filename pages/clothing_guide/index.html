        <h2>Classroom Attire</h2>
        <p>For class attendance at the academy, business casual clothing is required. We ask that all students dress in clothing that is neat, free of holes, and is moderate. We wish for you to be able to express your personality through your clothing choices, however keep it age appropriate. All skirts that are worn to class need to be no shorter than mid-thigh. Shorts are not allowed in the classroom, but crop pants are.</p>

        <h2>Free Time Attire:</h2>
        <p>The dress for your free time here at school is a bit more relaxed. Enjoy your favorite t-shirts, shorts, jeans, and shoes. We ask that your clothing remains within the community's moderate theme, thus no revealing clothing and it needs to be age appropriate. Which means no bootie shorts, no lace front tops, etcetera without something under it to cover you up. We do understand that at times it can be difficult to find clothing that covers everything up, but please ask for help. Most of us have tips and tricks on how to make things work with other additions to your wardrobe.</p>

        <h2>Formals:</h2>
        <p>For some events on the sim, there will be times you will need formal attire. Please keep the dresses age appropriate. No plunging necklines or fully exposed backs.

      <section id="undergarments">
        <h2>Undergarments/Alpha’ing:</h2>
        <p>It is strongly suggested that all avatars on the sim wear undergarments at all times. It helps to prevent rezzing “clothing malfunctions.” We also encourage those of you using mesh bodies to take advantage of the alpha features on your huds to ensure that all your bits and bobs are either covered or hiding. most bodies also come with underwear features built in and that Merfolk and Werewolves take advantage of said feature when shifting forms</p>
