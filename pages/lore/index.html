	<h2>Our World</h2>
	<p>Magic has always existed. Like the tide it ebbs and flows and those tied closely to magic have always been a relatively small part of the population of the Earth. The greatest eb in modern history started in approximately 800CE, with the islamic inquisition. It became harder for practitioners to see out those with the talent in order to train them in the ways of magic. It became more important to preserve and move to safer locations. The various wars and doctrines that punished those who were different, were harshest on those with magic. The Spanish inquisition was far harder on those residing in realms of magic. Thus causing many domains and groups to cut off from the world. The influence from outside sources became too much for those involved with magic and would cause their world to forever change.</p>
	<p>Human magic users realized that individuals were easy targets and personal libraries could be easily destroyed. Many elders gathered and created the Society of the Archivists, consisting of both magic and non-magical sympathizers. As the pressure from the outside world continued to grow, a council meeting was called when Magic started to fade and weaken. The Ley Lines were being disturbed somehow, lessening the powers of magical ability. The decision was made to attempt to preserve what they could before their powers were too weak and hide their secrets from the world. This led to the Great Preservation Spell of 1450. This also changed the focus from learning to saving knowledge. They no longer sought out new practitioners but hidden lore and old practitioners willing to join The Archivists.</p>
	<p>As time went on the Archivists worked in secret, moving in many different circles, with the hopes of procuring ancient texts or relics that held the secrets of magic. As the items filtered through auction houses, estate liquidations, and half chance sales the Archivists depository grew. The wealth that would be needed to sustain the collection was seen as perhaps the biggest hurdle that the organization would have to survive. Slowly over time families would gather and grow their wealth, keeping the secrets hidden to preserve the history of magic. It was with this that many of the influential families would rise to great power. In using their wealth, they continued to gather up the items that showed up in antique stores and such and created a collection called the reliquiae magicae, or relics of magic. This collection was protected with what lasting magic would keep the items hidden from eyes that were tracking the objects through time.</p>
	<p>Jean Paul Loire, was one of a long line of active mages within his family. Seeing the struggles that were occurring for the Archivists, he arranged for his family estate to become a storage and research facility for their work. Slowly and painfully, slight wards were placed and the Archivists continued their work. With America growing at an exponential rate, William set up a trust for his son Nathaniel to head to the states and attempt to help with the Archivists efforts there. Upon the completion of the estate in Tennessee, William divided the family collection and prepared for its departure stateside in the care of his youngest son, Nathaniel.</p>
	<p>Nathaniel G. Loire, a mage and Archivist, came from a Parisian family with strong ties to the British Museum. His family had spent generations collecting artifacts and housing them in their private archives. In 1846, Nathaniel moved to the United States with his family’s collection building a residence in Tennessee. With the Civil War moving like a tidal wave through the South of the Union, Loire vowed to continue to protect the secrets and artifacts which his family was tasked with. The artifacts survived the country’s turmoil, however Nathaniel did not. Forced into the fight, Nathaniel would lose his life leaving  his wife Katherine and his children to carry on the family’s legacy. Katherine renamed their family home in her husband's honor and passed on their family’s duty to their children. Over time their role grew greater and greater as it seemed that the ley lines that were dormant for so long, were beginning to pulsate with life once again.</p>
	<p>Slowly, those that had been driven into hiding in the past were reemerging with magical ability. Slowly filtering and growing strength in casting, and those with the ability to conduct certain types of magic were still scared to present themselves to the world. During the time the Archivists would travel the world now not only in search of the artifacts in which they were hoping to add to their collections, but in search of those who they felt needed their protection. Katherine and Nathaniel's children continued their own collection growth, however as time went on their estate grew with those seeking refuge from retribution from the outside world. It would be in this that the estate would become a school, Laurel Hills Academy. A location to teach the children of the world with their new found abilities, and provide a sanctuary from ridicule. </p>
	<p>Over time the family would prepare for what was coming and in that prepared for the Laurel Hills Academy to open its doors to the children of the world searching for refuse and guidance. Gregory Lorie, the Overseer of the Estate made the contacts that were needed to get everything open and operational. Remodeling his family's estate, the school was now ready for operations. With his staff selections in mind, everything would fall into place to get the school open on schedule. After contacting the potential staff candidates, and getting them into position so they would be able to get the school operational, it was time. With magic growing stronger every day, the doors of the school would open its warmth and hope for the future of all those with talents and gifts that need sanctuary.</p>
	<p>During the organization and structuring of Laurel Hills Academy, it was decided that each student demographic would require a guide on the journey of their growth. Archivists were dispatched with a quest of seeking out experienced, knowledgeable, and talented members of each mythological race and inviting them to the Academy with the opportunity of taking up the role of Mentor for the Students that would surely need a relatable figure to refer to for guidance.</p>
	<p>From the South, a Thin Blood was found that showed little interest in the position but accepted the offer out of a sense of obligation. From the North East, one passionate Archivist volunteered their services to fill the position for the mortals gifted with the ability to use the magic of the world. From there a Merfolk was discovered to be not only talented but willing to accept the role of mentor for their kind that will attend Laurel Hills. Next came the Lycan which took a bit of convincing, but with diligence and diplomacy, the last approach seemed to have persuaded the new mentor to join the cause for the education of their youth. </p>
	<p>With these four mentors on grounds of this new learning institution, their team was still incomplete as they lacked a mentor for the Elven students that would attend their halls.</p>
	<p>Soon enough, a wise and capable elf came forth and reached out for the opportunity to mentor their growing minds of the Academy while furthering their own knowledge. Though they don't always see eye to eye, the mentors show great devotion and dedication to make the mission of Laurel Hills a reality, inspiring success by transforming one life at a time.</p>

	<h2>Society of the Archivists</h2>
	<p>The Society of the Archivists was formed as a way for those that still possessed magic, could protect the artifacts and texts of the past under lock and key. Wards were placed over the building, through and through. As the remainder of their magic spread over the windows and doors of the building, the shimmer would fade leaving inside the now guarded items representing the remaining pieces of the past. The members of the society took a vow to protect the history of the races and magic with their lives. There was always a cost to protect secrets from those who wished to destroy them, this would be the highest sacrifice that someone could make. </p>
	<p>The location of the Archivist headquarters was to be kept secret, and in that so was the information. Upon the selected archivist being indoctrinated to the folds of the society, there would be a series of magical things that would happen. Upon the selected candidate entering the society, their name would go into the manifest, the book working as a link between all of their minds. It allowed for them to communicate information magically and secretively, but this also meant that when someone was removed from the ranks, their name would be cut off from the book and sever the link. If an archivist was to be put under duress, or was to be killed, it created a magical seal that would lock away the information that the archivist knew. Protecting the information that they knew from post-mortem magic, through the use of Necromancy.</p>
	<p>Over time the archivists would continue to work at gathering different items that could possibly hold either historical or magical value. These items would be stored in various different locations around the world, loaned and rotated through museums and other locations to keep them safe. When the items would be loaned out to museums, there would be magical wards placed on the displays to prevent theft. Over time, they tried to gather all the information they could decipher from the ancient texts and relics. Trying to unlock the information that they could use that could be helpful to them in keeping everyone safe. When the ley lines started to surge the artifacts and texts of the past would leech and feed off the magic. Slowly things would begin to appear, words would start to make sense. It was in this that more reports were coming in from across the globe of things starting to happen. </p>
	<p>The council of the society contacted their most trusted associates and would be commissioned for the design and protection of a school for those with abilities. In that they decided that a school was to be created, there to educate and protect the children that would soon find their powers growing and not understand what was happening. So the first wave of Archivists were sent to Tennessee to the newly founded Laurel Hills Academy, and started to filter through the Loire collection of artifacts and texts. Setting up the Archives and vault and when the decision was made, they chose the associate that would serve as the school’s first Archivist. Leaving them to help run and assist the school, alongside the headmaster and the overseer of the estate. </p>
