	<h2>Our World</h2>
	<p>Magic has always existed. Like the tide it ebbs and flows and those tied closely to magic have always been a relatively small part of the population of the Earth. The greatest eb in modern history started in approximately 800CE, with the islamic inquisition. It became harder for practitioners to see out those with the talent in order to train them in the ways of magic. It became more important to preserve and move to safer locations. The various wars and doctrines that punished those who were different, were harshest on those with magic. The Spanish inquisition was far harder on those residing in realms of magic. Thus causing many domains and groups to cut off from the world. The influence from outside sources became too much for those involved with magic and would cause their world to forever change.</p>
	<p>Human magic users realized that individuals were easy targets and personal libraries could be easily destroyed. Many elders gathered and created the Society of the Archivists, consisting of both magic and non-magical sympathizers. As the pressure from the outside world continued to grow, a council meeting was called when Magic started to fade and weaken. The Ley Lines were being disturbed somehow, lessening the powers of magical ability. The decision was made to attempt to preserve what they could before their powers were too weak and hide their secrets from the world. This led to the Great Preservation Spell of 1450. This also changed the focus from learning to saving knowledge. They no longer sought out new practitioners but hidden lore and old practitioners willing to join The Archivists.</p>
	<p>As time went on the Archivists worked in secret, moving in many different circles, with the hopes of procuring ancient texts or relics that held the secrets of magic. As the items filtered through auction houses, estate liquidations, and half chance sales the Archivists depository grew. The wealth that would be needed to sustain the collection was seen as perhaps the biggest hurdle that the organization would have to survive. Slowly over time families would gather and grow their wealth, keeping the secrets hidden to preserve the history of magic. It was with this that many of the influential families would rise to great power. In using their wealth, they continued to gather up the items that showed up in antique stores and such and created a collection called the reliquiae magicae, or relics of magic. This collection was protected with what lasting magic would keep the items hidden from eyes that were tracking the objects through time.</p>
	<p>Jean Paul Loire, was one of a long line of active mages within his family. Seeing the struggles that were occurring for the Archivists, he arranged for his family estate to become a storage and research facility for their work. Slowly and painfully, slight wards were placed and the Archivists continued their work. With America growing at an exponential rate, William set up a trust for his son Nathaniel to head to the states and attempt to help with the Archivists efforts there. Upon the completion of the estate in Tennessee, William divided the family collection and prepared for its departure stateside in the care of his youngest son, Nathaniel.</p>
	<p>Nathaniel G. Loire, a mage and Archivist, came from a Parisian family with strong ties to the British Museum. His family had spent generations collecting artifacts and housing them in their private archives. In 1846, Nathaniel moved to the United States with his family’s collection building a residence in Tennessee. With the Civil War moving like a tidal wave through the South of the Union, Loire vowed to continue to protect the secrets and artifacts which his family was tasked with. The artifacts survived the country’s turmoil, however Nathaniel did not. Forced into the fight, Nathaniel would lose his life leaving  his wife Katherine and his children to carry on the family’s legacy. Katherine renamed their family home in her husband's honor and passed on their family’s duty to their children. Over time their role grew greater and greater as it seemed that the ley lines that were dormant for so long, were beginning to pulsate with life once again.</p>
	<p>Slowly, those that had been driven into hiding in the past were reemerging with magical ability. Slowly filtering and growing strength in casting, and those with the ability to conduct certain types of magic were still scared to present themselves to the world. During the time the Archivists would travel the world now not only in search of the artifacts in which they were hoping to add to their collections, but in search of those who they felt needed their protection. Katherine and Nathaniel's children continued their own collection growth, however as time went on their estate grew with those seeking refuge from retribution from the outside world. It would be in this that the estate would become a school, Laurel Hills Academy. A location to teach the children of the world with their new found abilities, and provide a sanctuary from ridicule. </p>
	<p>Over time the family would prepare for what was coming and in that prepared for the Laurel Hills Academy to open its doors to the children of the world searching for refuse and guidance. Gregory Lorie, the Overseer of the Estate made the contacts that were needed to get everything open and operational. Remodeling his family's estate, the school was now ready for operations. With his staff selections in mind, everything would fall into place to get the school open on schedule. After contacting the potential staff candidates, and getting them into position so they would be able to get the school operational, it was time. With magic growing stronger every day, the doors of the school would open its warmth and hope for the future of all those with talents and gifts that need sanctuary.</p>
	<p>During the organization and structuring of Laurel Hills Academy, it was decided that each student demographic would require a guide on the journey of their growth. Archivists were dispatched with a quest of seeking out experienced, knowledgeable, and talented members of each mythological race and inviting them to the Academy with the opportunity of taking up the role of Mentor for the Students that would surely need a relatable figure to refer to for guidance.</p>
	<p>From the South, a Thin Blood was found that showed little interest in the position but accepted the offer out of a sense of obligation. From the North East, one passionate Archivist volunteered their services to fill the position for the mortals gifted with the ability to use the magic of the world. From there a Merfolk was discovered to be not only talented but willing to accept the role of mentor for their kind that will attend Laurel Hills. Next came the Lycan which took a bit of convincing, but with diligence and diplomacy, the last approach seemed to have persuaded the new mentor to join the cause for the education of their youth. </p>
	<p>With these four mentors on grounds of this new learning institution, their team was still incomplete as they lacked a mentor for the Elven students that would attend their halls.</p>
	<p>Soon enough, a wise and capable elf came forth and reached out for the opportunity to mentor their growing minds of the Academy while furthering their own knowledge. Though they don't always see eye to eye, the mentors show great devotion and dedication to make the mission of Laurel Hills a reality, inspiring success by transforming one life at a time.</p>
