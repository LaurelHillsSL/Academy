<section id = "elemental_affinity_attunement">
  <h2>Elemental Affinity/Attunement</h2>
  <p>Although students might have a natural pull to certain elements, the final attunement has taken place upon the start of a students third year here at the academy. Remember, the element selects you. At the ceremony, there will be different representations of the elements present and the element that is most drawn to the student will become apparent. This is a special moment in one’s life so let's all try to be respectful and happy for those we are welcoming into the elemental houses. If a student has an elemental Affinity this will also happen at the elemental selection ceremony. Secondary elements have a way of surprising us sometimes and after the more dominant element has made its selection apparent, the secondary will then make its selection.</p>
</section>
<section id = "affinity">
  <h2>Affinity</h2>
  <p>Each person has a personal affinity to a certain element based on many different factors such as when you were born, where you were born, who your parents are, where the kitchen sink was on your eleventh birthday. However, there are also other factors that can change, alter, and or effect one’s elemental affinity, like race. Certain races have a fixed affinity and that is just the natural order of alignment. It's part of what makes us who we are. Others, well that is to be determined over time and with patience. Affinity is determined around a child's 13th birthday, or approximately 3rd year of schooling.</p>
</section>
<section id = "attunement">
  <h2>Attunement</h2>
  <p>Although one can only have one elemental affinity, it is not uncommon for a person to have several attunements. This is one’s elemental pulls that show them favor upon occasion when dealing with different situations in which elements are at play. For some, if they can grasp their affinity and practice their attunement, it is not unheard of for those two elements to be able to be combined and manipulated together.</p>
</section>
<section id = "sorting">
  <h2>Sorting</h2>
  <p>We do not select the elements, the elements select us. Upon a student entering into their third year of education here at the school there will be an elemental selection. The student will present themselves before the stones and the element will select the student. This is a very special moment for everyone and begins the journey of the rest of their lives.</p>
</section>
<section id = "school_rules">

<section id = "class_details">
  <h2>Class Details</h2>
  <p>The school year operates on a quarterly system. Every quarter there will be new opportunities for you to attend classes and to experience the academy. Classes here at the academy will normally run for an hour, however it is up to the instructor on their own personal class time. Some days they may require additional time for the material that they wish to cover. Once you have selected your classes for the term, please ensure that you follow up with your instructors to obtain the information that you need for the class.</p>
</section>
<section id = "class_options">
  <h2>Class Requirements/Attendance Options</h2>
  <p>Here at the academy, we understand that time is valuable. We understand that sometimes classes can crossover or interfere with other courses that a student may need. We have devised a curriculum option plan for students and staff, to work together cohesively and strive for everyone's academic excellence. There are three class attendance options for students here at the school:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Attend the classes, complete the coursework, and take the class exit examination.</li>
    <li>If you can not attend the classes, talk to the professor about independent study which would include completing all the coursework and exams.</li>
    <li>If you can not arrange for independent study, then you would need to complete all the coursework, and test out of the subject. This is a case by case basis that will be handled by the Associate Headmaster or the Headmaster.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section id = "punishments">  
  <h2>Punishments</h2>

<section id = "campus_life">
  <h2>  Campus Life</h2>
  <p>Here at Laurel Hills Academy we strive to provide the amenities that students will need on a daily basis around campus. There is a kitchen for students to eat at as well as several local locations where students may choose to get food. There are delivery restaurants in the area that will deliver to the school, but make sure you tip the drivers! </p>
  <p>For those wishing to stay on campus, there are dormitories for those in their first and second year. Once you have completed your elemental attunement, you will then be shifted to your elemental house. </p>
  <h3>Dormitories</h3>
  <p>Laurel Hills Academy is a day school and boarding school. There are dormitories on campus located in the school for students. The third floor of the main building has been converted into living spaces for those wishing to reside on campus. The main building dormitories will service students that are first and second year. Older students may choose to stay in the main building if they prefer.</p>
  <h3>Dorm Leaders</h3>
  <p>There will be a selection of students who will serve as dorm leaders for a quarter. These students will serve as a proxy for helping the other students that live on campus adjust, and also letting staff know when assistance is needed.</p>
  <h3>Elemental Houses</h3>
  <p>The elemental houses around campus are decorated in the corresponding colors of the elements in which they represent. The Common Rooms of the Elemental Houses are open to anyone, however we ask that you please respect there are times that the houses will have bonding activities and meetings that are only open to house members. There are also dormitories above the common rooms that will house the members of the houses on campus.</p>
  <h3>House Leaders</h3>
  <p>These exemplary students will be selected to represent their house on the student council. It does not come without its own set of responsibilities though. Each house leader is responsible for maintaining the house, keeping up with curfew, and dealing with attempting to resolve issues in the house before going to the staff of the school for resolution. House leaders will also be responsible for assisting when the Associate Headmaster or Headmaster calls for them.</p>
  <h3>Exemplars</h3>
  <p>These are students that are hand picked as exemplary students of the school to work hand in hand with the staff, mentors, house leaders, and dorm leaders. It is their job to help with the students at school and to lead and be a guiding example to others.</p>
</section>
<section id = "student_leadership">
  <h2>Student Leadership</h2>
  <p>There will be a student council composed of the house leader from each house, dorm leader from the dormitories, and one staff/faculty member. The official meetings will be held twice a quarter to address issues or the needs of the students on campus. </p>
</section>
<section id = "clubs">
  <h2>Student Clubs/Organizations</h2>
  <p>Clubs/Organizations are allowed on campus after permission is granted from the school staff. Please see the Associate Headmaster or the Headmaster to submit your idea for a student club/organization that needs to be typed and include all the details and what you would need to run the group.</p>
