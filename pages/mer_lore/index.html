  <p>Merfolk can live up to 500 years</p>
  <p>Affinity: Water</p>
  <p>For centuries, it's been debated if these aquatic creatures could even be considered people. Often called the Sirens of Tides, this ocean-dwelling society has had quite a fluctuating reputation. Some civilizations of the world viewed their kind as beautiful gods and goddesses of the sea, while others called them the demons of the depths. All of these were nothing but stories and tales that bore fruit through drunken taverns and rumors that spread across nations.The truth was that with every culture, came cultural behavior, and the Merfolk were no exception to this reality. Some made war and confrontation with the land dwellers because of their obsessive fishing habits while others remained quiet and isolated to themselves. Their underwater world was a beautiful sight to behold that not many air breathers were given the chance to see, and those who did would never see it again.</p>
  <p>The Merfolk are a race of humanoids with the upper torso of humans and the lower body of an aquatic species. They hold natural beauty as well as extraordinary swimming prowess. Gifted with a talent for hydrokinesis, they also possessed the wonderful gift of being wonderful singers due to their extended vocal structure in their biology. On land, they are able to morph their aquatic half in exchange for legs, often roaming the land and associating themselves with humans. Learning, trading, and even raising children alongside them. Though they possess the ability to traverse dry land, they must return to the water at least once every two days to maintain their health. With the sudden disappearance of magic, the Merfolk felt it unsafe to remain on the surface and returned to their hidden cities below the waves where they remained quiet and out of sight. Creating secluded communities to shelter and protect their own. Some were rumored to be spotted near the Mariana Trench whereas others were seen within the storms that stir in the Bermuda Triangle.</p>
  <p>During this period of magical silence, they too seemed to have become a legend or myth across the globe for hundreds of years, leaving only the imagination of humanity to keep track of their previous existence. It wasn't until a surge of magic pulsed across the globe did the merfolk once more become curious of the activities on the surface. The pulse of ley lines sent waves of magical energy, rippling through the water and felt by the communities that had stayed cut off from the world for so long. Emerging from the waters, the aquatic creatures were shocked by how much had changed since their last point of contact with humans. Elders kept their ears open and heard mention of a school by the name of Laurel Hills Academy and the formation of a group that called themselves the Archivists. Through Scrying and patience, they managed to get in contact with a member of their group to learn more. In exchange for knowledge, the Archivists agreed to assist the merfolk and guided them to the newly founded school so they and their children could become reacclimated to the modern world.</p>
